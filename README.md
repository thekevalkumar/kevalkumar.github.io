# kevalkumar.github.io — Portfolio (proposed)

This repository contains a simple React + TypeScript + Tailwind portfolio scaffold.

How to run locally (example using Vite)
1. Create a Vite React + TS project if one isn't already installed, or install dependencies:
   - npm init vite@latest my-portfolio -- --template react-ts
   - or add `react`, `react-dom`, `vite`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Start the dev server
   npm run dev

Notes
- The scaffold imports `globals.css` at the project root (the file you already have).
- Tailwind should already be configured in the repo if you're using it — the scaffold relies on Tailwind being available.
- If you'd like, I can push these files to your repository and optionally add a deployment workflow (GitHub Pages or GitHub Actions).
